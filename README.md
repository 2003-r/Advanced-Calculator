Project Title: Advanced Calculator with Memory and Error Handling
Description: This advanced calculator application goes beyond basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by incorporating features such as:
Remainder Function: 
  Calculates the remainder of integer division. 
    Exponentiation: Computes powers (x^n) without using built-in functions, implemented with loops. 
    Square Root Calculation: Calculates square roots.
    
  The calculator allows users to chain operations, retrieve previously saved results, and handle incorrect inputs gracefully without terminating the program.
  It includes memory functionality where users can save results and retrieve or list them for further use. 
The project was implemented in Python, JavaScript, and C#, demonstrating cross-language proficiency.
